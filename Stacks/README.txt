Project Title:	Stacks
Project Description: This is a program that implements the use of object stacks to convert infix expressions to postfix expressions and then evaluate 
those post fix expressions. To do this, the program first parses lines of infix expressions from a text file and checks to see if they are valid. 
Once they pass the validity test, it is then when the infix expression can be converted to postfix.
