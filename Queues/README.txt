Project Title: Multi Feedback Queue Simulation
Project Description: This program simulates an operating systemâ€™s job scheduling policy to determine which process will be assigned the CPU when it becomes available. 
The program loads 16 jobs from mfq.txt and goes through the cpu. If the job does not finish or new job arrives into the system while cpu is busy, the job is placed 
into a lower queue. The program will print out to the console when it arrives in the system and when it departs out of the cpu. Statistics from the simulation are calculated.
